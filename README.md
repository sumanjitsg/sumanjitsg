## What's my story?
Started at Cavium on the Liquid Security team as a firmware test engineerâ€”breaking things, automating tests in Perl, and learning how products fail. My curiosity for development led me to learn Linux kernel development in C, picking up dev tasks outside my role and seeing them through to completion.

Moved to the Data Modeler team at Erwin, where I built an ANTLR parser module in C++ that accelerated new database integrations. Later there, I built the first prototype to modernize our legacy Microsoft Foundation Class desktop app to a SaaS web platform. That's where frontend won me over.

## What am I building?
Today, I am a Senior Frontend Lead at Visionet, leading the AI-powered knowledge platform development team, architecting micro-frontends for rapid deployment at scale and driving a culture of test-driven development with CI/CD pipelines.

I bring 8+ years of technical depth, product mindset, and helping teams bring product ideas to life quickly.

## Technologies I love:
- Frontend: TypeScript, React, Elm, Zustand, Mantine, Zod, Rsbuild
- Backend: Google Cloud, Node, Docker, Drizzle
